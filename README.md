# Deep Belief Network

The aim of this work is to apply the learned techniques of visual concept learning to the popular FashionMNIST dataset. We use a DBN to performe a serie of tasks:

1. Visualitzation of the receptive fields of each layer of the DBN.
2. Cluster the internal representations for each layer using dendrograms.
3. Linear Read-Out at each layer and comparision with a FFNN with the same architecure.
4. Evaluation of the robustness to noise.
5. Evaluation of the robustness to adversarial attacks and application of top-down reconstructions to handle them.

All this work was previously studied during the lab sessions of the Cognition and Computation subject by UNIPD.
